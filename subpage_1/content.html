        <h2>1. Understanding the Audience</h2>
    <p>When designing this microsite, the very first step I took was to understand the needs of the target audience.<br>
        In this first phase, it is crucial to emphathise with and define problems that users may face while using this microsite.<br>
        I came up with user scenarios, such as the one below, which helped me to describe possible realistic behaviours and needs that may happen in user interactions, <br>
        and enable me to identify and focus on these issues.

                            John is a 25 year old frequent traveler who loves discovering new cultures and experiences. He is keen on a trip to East Asia, but is uncertain on which part or countries to travel to. <br>
                            He is looking for a site that promotes travel to East Asia, and one that can provide him with a wide range of recommended options. <br>
                            John expects to encounter a user-friendly interface that is easy to navigate, and allows him to quickly search up information on different destinations. <br>
                            John would also like to be able to read reviews and ratings by other travelers and see photos and videos of places he is interested to visit. <br>
                            These would help motivate and make him feel that he is making the right choice if he decides to go on a trip to one of these places.<br>
                            Overall, John wants a reliable, informative and easy to use website that will help him on his travels.

                    John is an avid traveler and wants to plan a holiday to East Asia, but he is overwhelmed by the information available online and needs to find a user-friendly website which can provide him with 
                    recommended options, reviews and ratings, and additional content about destinations that would help him make a more informed decision.

        <h2>2. Exploring and Ideating</h2>

        <p>
            In this phase, I used the problem statement to brainstorm possible solutions that would create a more user-friendly and user-centric design for the microsite.<br>
            I came up with the following solutions:
            <ul>
                <li>Include multimedia content of potential destinations to help users envision their trips to make informed decisions.
                </li><br>
                <li>Provide personalised recommendations that can be generated based on preference so users can find more suitable destinations that match their interests.
                </li><br>
                <li>A responsive site optimised for mobile devices, as many travellers would be reliant on their devices to access information and plan trips on the go.
                </li><br>
                <li>Design an interface that is minimalist and aesthetically pleasing, to reduce the chance of overloading the user with information.
                </li>
            </ul>

        <h2>3. Materialising Ideas</h2>

        <p>
           With the solutions above at hand, I had to ensure that they were implemented successfully.<br>
           To tie these solutions together into a workable and functioning framework, users could <br>
           select from several ideas they were interested in regarding their plans for a trip, and the website would provide
           a suitable recommendation based on their choices, which would include multimedia content that would provide information and confidence to users for making their decision.

        <h2>4. Actual Implementation</h2>

        <p>
            First, by providing an easy-to-understand navigation menu, users can quickly and easily find the information they are looking for. The use of icons in the menu also helps users create a match between the navigation system and the real world.<br><br>
            Responsive design is also essential to creating a positive user experience. In this microsite, responsive elements, components, and images adapt to different (usually smaller) screen sizes, ensuring that users have a seamless and consistent experience across all devices. By creating a responsive design, the layout and content of the microsite can adjust to fit the screen size of the user's device, ensuring good readability and navigation on both desktop and mobile devices. Furthermore, this reduces the need for scrolling or zooming, which makes the site more accessible and user-friendly. In addition, responsive design also helps to improve website loading times, crucial for creating a positive user experience.<br><br>
            Consistency and standards are upheld by maintaining a consistent design throughout the website. The microsite uses a consistent visual style and branding that aligns with the friendly, straightforward, and informative tone of the site. This helps to build trust and credibility and aims to make the microsite more memorable to users.<br>
            The microsite aims to provide high-quality and engaging content that is informative, visually appealing, and easy to understand. This helps to keep users active and engaged while using the site and its features.<br><br>
            Additionally, through offering personalized recommendations and suggestions in its contents based on the user's preferences, this creates a unique experience that is relevant and tailored to the userâ€™s needs.<br><br>
            Finally, to encourage even more user engagement, this microsite includes user ratings, as well as social media sharing buttons.<br><br>
            With these objectives in mind, this website hopes to create a positive and memorable experience for its users.
