        <h2>1. Understanding the Audience</h2>
    <p>When designing this microsite, the very first step I took was to understand the needs of the target audience.<br>
        In this first phase, it is crucial to emphathise with and define problems that users may face while using this microsite.<br>
        I came up with user scenarios, such as the one below, which helped me to describe possible realistic behaviours and needs that may happen in user interactions, <br>
        and enable me to identify and focus on these issues.

                            John is a 25 year old frequent traveler who loves discovering new cultures and experiences. He is keen on a trip to East Asia, but is uncertain on which part or countries to travel to. <br>
                            He is looking for a site that promotes travel to East Asia, and one that can provide him with a wide range of recommended options. <br>
                            John expects to encounter a user-friendly interface that is easy to navigate, and allows him to quickly search up information on different destinations. <br>
                            John would also like to be able to read reviews and ratings by other travelers and see photos and videos of places he is interested to visit. <br>
                            These would help motivate and make him feel that he is making the right choice if he decides to go on a trip to one of these places.<br>
                            Overall, John wants a reliable, informative and easy to use website that will help him on his travels.

                    John is an avid traveler and wants to plan a holiday to East Asia, but he is overwhelmed by the information available online and needs to find a user-friendly website which can provide him with 
                    recommended options, reviews and ratings, and additional content about destinations that would help him make a more informed decision.

        <h2>2. Exploring and Ideating</h2>

        <p>
            In this phase, I used the problem statement to brainstorm possible solutions that would create a more user-friendly and user-centric design for the microsite.<br>
            I came up with the following solutions:
            <ul>
                <li>Include multimedia content of potential destinations to help users envision their trips to make informed decisions.
                </li><br>
                <li>Provide personalised recommendations that can be generated based on preference so users can find more suitable destinations that match their interests.
                </li><br>
                <li>A responsive site optimised for mobile devices, as many travellers would be reliant on their devices to access information and plan trips on the go.
                </li><br>
                <li>Design an interface that is minimalist and aesthetically pleasing, to reduce the chance of overloading the user with information.
                </li>
            </ul>

        <h2>3. Materialising and Implementing</h2>

        <p>
           With the solutions above at hand, I had to ensure that they were implemented successfully.<br>
           To tie these solutions together into a workable and functioning framework, users could <br>
           select from several ideas they were interested in regarding their plans for a trip, and the website would provide
           a suitable recommendation based on their choices, which would include multimedia content that would provide information and confidence to users for making their decision.
